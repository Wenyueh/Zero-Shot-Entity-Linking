{"title": "Fifth Doctor", "text": "Fifth Doctor Youthful in mind , manner and appearance , the Fifth Doctor expressed an interest in all things Victorian and Edwardian : cricket , tea , fair play , good manners , and a keen interest in science and exploration . He was also a sensitive and profusely humane incarnation of the Doctor , who did not make himself an imposition , preferring to be honest , reserved , and honourable . However , the Fifth Doctor was also less willing to do what he thought was immoral , and became highly conflicted about what choices he could make in a crisis that were truly right . His hesitancy made him seemingly more fallible than many other incarnations , making those around him wonder if he was capable of resolving difficult situations . Nevertheless , he was one of the most overtly fearless incarnations , and frequently found himself right in the thick of battle . Like his first two incarnations , the Fifth Doctor often travelled with multiple companions . However , his TARDIS was rarely as harmonious as those of his predecessors . Instead , he frequently found himself stuck between Tegan Jovanka ' s pessimism and Adric ' s arrogance or Turlough ' s antagonism . Stuck in the middle with him was usually Nyssa . Even after he seemingly was settled on just having one companion , he and Peri Brown found another companion , a pharaoh from Egypt called Erimem , and the Doctor once again slid into the role of the oft - maligned chaperone . During his final adventure , the Doctor accidentally exposed himself and Peri to unrefined spectrox , contracting fatal spectrox toxaemia . Though he acquired an antidote , the Doctor had only enough for one person ; he gave it to Peri . Not knowing if the disease could kill Time Lords for good , the Doctor gambled on regeneration saving his life , successfully regenerating after experiencing a vision of the Master and his former companions . Biography . A day to come .

While he was recovering ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" ) and entering into a hallucination , ( PROSE : \" The Comet ' s Tail \" ) a message came from Adric , whom had abducted , saying the TARDIS was heading for Event One . The Doctor left Tegan and Nyssa instructions on how to escape by jettisoning rooms from the TARDIS . Much of the Zero Room was jettisoned and the Doctor , needing a peaceful place to continue his stabilisation , went to Castrovalva . After he had recovered , he learned the city was artificial , created by block transfer computations . The Master , in the guise of the Portreeve , had created the city with Adric ' s brilliant mind . The Doctor rescued Adric and the TARDIS crew fled Castrovalva as it collapsed in on itself , leaving the Master to be erased from existence with it . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" ) Early adventures . The Doctor and his companions visited what appeared to be a planet inhabited by highly unusual people , but eventually realised that they were on the Psychodrome , where their memories , desires and fears were being brought to life .

Helping Cranleigh win a match , the Doctor and his friends were invited to a fancy - dress ball to celebrate . The Doctor ' s costume was stolen and used as a disguise during a murder , which led to the Doctor being framed by Lady Cranleigh for the crime . The Doctor cleared his name by revealing the TARDIS , and uncovering a Cranleigh family secret : Cranleigh ' s supposedly deceased brother , George Cranleigh , who had been mentally and physically scarred by natives during a trip to find a rare flower , was the culprit .

( AUDIO : \" The Darkening Eye \" ) Hearing alarms warning about spatial anomalies , the Doctor rushed to a room in a distant corner of the TARDIS without explaining to Adric and Tegan what was going on . There , they found Nyssa lying on the floor with a jewel .

( PROSE : \" Hearts of Stone \" ) Adric became distant towards the Doctor , Nyssa and Tegan , causing him to request a return to E - Space , which the Doctor angrily denied out of fear that he would become trapped in the mini - universe again .

Arriving on Androzani Minor , the Doctor and Peri were caught in a struggle over the mineral spectrox . As they dealt with gun runners , government troops , crooked politicians and a masked madman called Sharaz Jek , the Doctor and Peri were exposed to raw spectrox and contracted the fatal Spectrox toxaemia . Through a perilous descent into the lower caves of the planet , the Doctor managed to get his hands on the milk of a queen bat , the only known cure for the poisoning , but he was only able to recover one dose . He then chose to give Peri the dose , saving her life at the cost of his own . Succumbing to the poisoning , the Doctor collapsed on the floor of the TARDIS , not entirely sure if he would regenerate , wondering aloud if he was failing to regenerate , and commenting that the regenerative process \" [ felt ] different this time \" . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) During his regeneration , tried to interfere via Kamelion ' s lingering connection to the TARDIS , but the Doctor was saved by Nyssa and her husband Lasarti , who connected with him in his mindscape and helped break the mental link allowing the Master to block his regeneration . ( AUDIO : \" Winter \" ) Seeing visions of his former companions urging him to live and insisting that the universe still had need of him , the Doctor rejected the Master ' s assertion that he must die and regenerated into his sixth incarnation . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) Post - mortem . After his regeneration , the fifth incarnation became the mental personification of the Doctor ' s conscience . ( PROSE : \" \" ) When trapped in a dimensionally - unstable pocket universe controlled by Iam and the Rani , the Sixth Doctor ' s morphic print was destabilised , causing him to unwillingly regress back through his previous incarnations as his body sought a stable morphic print . ( PROSE : \" State of Change \" ) During his seventh incarnation , the mental manifestation of the Fifth Doctor was locked away by the others so that the Doctor could do what he believed he had to do in order to stop the powerful Timewyrm , but when Ace found herself trapped in the Doctor ' s mind when the Doctor ' s plan to destroy the Timewyrm by crushing it in his head would have killed her as well , she found and released the trapped Fifth Doctor , restoring the Doctor ' s conscience and inspiring the Seventh Doctor to find another way . ( PROSE : \" \" ) When the Eighth Doctor was possessed by Zagreus and stabbed by Charley Pollard , he met the mental manifestations of his fifth , sixth and seventh incarnations in his mind when he nearly allowed himself to die , subsequently rallying himself with their aid to restore himself and retake control of the anti - time energies . ( AUDIO : \" Zagreus \" ) When the Ninth Doctor ' s Sin - Eater became conscious due to the Doctor ' s telepathic nature , it mutated to show the Fifth Doctor ' s face , among other incarnations , straining against its body . ( COMIC : \" Sin - Eaters \" ) When the Tenth Doctor was confronted by Es ' Cartrss within the TARDIS ' Matrix , he summoned the Fifth Doctor , among his other past incarnations , to use their united memories and willpower to take back control of the Matrix . ( COMIC : \" The Forgotten \" ) After the Eleventh Doctor was accused of committing deadly crimes against the Overcast , he brooded in the TARDIS for two days , imagining all his previous numbered incarnations , including the Fifth Doctor , interrogating him over the crimes . When he offered the rational that he always left things better than he found them , they all turned and left him in disgust and disgrace . ( COMIC : \" Pull to Open \" ) When the Eleventh Doctor was attacked by the Then and the Now on Lujhimene , the Fifth Doctor was among the incarnations seen as the Doctor ' s timeline was almost destroyed . ( COMIC : \" Running to Stay Still \" ) When the Eleventh Doctor entered into the T ' keyn Nexus in order to defend himself , Matrix projections of his previous incarnations , including the Fifth Doctor , appeared inside it to defend themselves as well . When the Fourth Doctor told auditor Sondrah that neither the T ' keyn nor the Time Lord s would understand his love for the Earth , the Fifth Doctor recalled his efforts to change the Time Lords , and then reflected how the people of Earth had inspired him to better himself . When the Eleventh Doctor began to deduce Sondrah ' s true identity , the past Doctors faded away as Oscar Wilde interfered with the Nexus . ( COMIC : \" Dead Man ' s Hand \" ) When Clara Oswald entered the Doctor ' s time stream , she saw the fifth incarnation among the Doctors that ran past her , with the Eleventh Doctor claiming them to be his \" ghosts \" . ( TV : \" The Name of the Doctor \" ) When he was exposed to energy from a time storm , the Twelfth Doctor degenerated through all of his previous incarnations , including the Fifth Doctor . ( AUDIO : \" The Lost Magic \" ) Other realities . Alternate timelines . In an alternative timeline created by the influence of the Valeyard using the Dark Matrix , the Fifth Doctor was able to resist the Valeyard ' s influence for most of his life , but he eventually succumbed at what would have been the end of his life , taking the bat ' s milk antidote to the Spectrox toxaemia and letting Peri die in his place . This timeline was eventually undone by the Seventh Doctor . ( PROSE : \" Matrix \" ) In an alternate timeline , the Doctor was able to save Adric . In another alternative timeline , the Doctor had his brain fried by a computer while substituting for a dead synch - op on the Sea Base in 2084 . In a third alternative timeline , the Doctor never went to Androzani Minor . ( PROSE : \" So Vile a Sin \" ) In one timeline , the Doctor died on Androzani Minor due to the Great Intelligence ' s interference . ( TV : \" The Name of the Doctor \" ) When the Cybermen allied with Rassilon to take over history , the TARDIS was caught in a time corridor that led the Doctor and Peri to a Skaro which was occupied by the Cybermen . ( COMIC : \" \" ) The Doctor announced to Peri that the Cybermen had wiped that Daleks from history , and the two ran from a unit erupting in energy . This timeline was eventually unwritten by Rassilon and the Twelfth Doctor . ( COMIC : \" Supremacy of the Cybermen \" ) Psychological profile . Personality . The fifth incarnation was the most open and vulnerable of all the Doctors , coming across as na\u00efve and inexperienced , acting like a child excited to see new worlds and foreign places . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" Earthshock \" ) He was neither pretentious nor selfish and reacted to situations rather than starting them , with his humanity making him panicky and indecisive under pressure , but he would use dissembling and deceit in order to avert a crisis or defeat an adversary . ( TV : \" Frontios \" ) His young appearance was reflected in the youthfulness of his companions , whom he treated like friends rather than subordinates , with their pain and sorrow affecting him deeply , ( TV : \" Earthshock \" , \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) and their safety his top priority . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) This incarnation also felt suited for settling down and starting a family . ( AUDIO : \" Loups - Garoux \" , \" Winter \" ) However , the Doctor ' s boyish appearance , nervous energy , and charm all hid the fact that he was a Time Lord of great age , compassion , and experience . He was willing to take chances with companions like Vislor Turlough and Kamelion , who were originally threats , ( TV : \" Mawdryn Undead \" , \" The King ' s Demons \" ) even as he pretended to be unaware of it in order to grant Turlough the opportunity to do the right thing . ( TV : \" Enlightenment \" ) He was also willing to make enormous personal sacrifices simply to keep his word and liberate others from suffering , ( TV : \" Mawdryn Undead \" ) and would stop and help others while dealing with greater threats . ( TV : \" Arc of Infinity \" ) After finding a cricket bat and discovering a room in his TARDIS dedicated to the sport shortly after his regeneration , the Doctor became a vivid fan of cricket , ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" Black Orchid \" ) attending several famous matches , ( AUDIO : \" The Roof of the World \" , \" Nekromanteia \" , \" The Emerald Tiger \" ; PROSE : \" Graham Dilley Saves the World \" ) and teaching his companions the rules of the game . ( AUDIO : \" Phantasmagoria \" ) Despite his youthful body and love of cricket , the fifth incarnation was one of the least physical Doctors , preferring to use diplomacy to solve a problem . He was , however , still very capable when pushed to physical confrontations . ( TV : \" The King ' s Demons \" ) He gained trust by proving himself instead of using his vast experience as an excuse to take charge . Indeed , he worked willingly under the leadership of others who had the strong command presence that he lacked . This did not mean he did not take charge in moments of intensity , ( TV : \" Kinda \" , \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) or frustration . ( TV : \" Time Crash \" ) The Doctor was notably sarcastic , especially towards Tegan and Adric , usually in the politest way possible . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" The Five Doctors \" , \" Frontios \" ) He also tried to find a positive approach to life , even if it was a delusional one , ( AUDIO : \" Iterations of I \" ) fixating on the idea that Mondas was 1950s Trafalgar Square , willfully ignoring the mine carts and giant underground cavern overhead , ( AUDIO : \" Spare Parts \" ) and when he and Nyssa were arrested for using future currency during the Jacobin era , the Doctor consoled Nyssa by pointing out that they still used Earth - based coins . ( AUDIO : \" Circular Time \" ) He identified himself as open minded , likening himself to Alice as he \" tried to believe three impossible things before breakfast \" . ( TV : \" The Five Doctors \" ) Being an open minded incarnation , the Fifth Doctor was willing to give his enemies the benefit of the doubt , such as when he met in the Death Zone on Gallifrey , and was willing to hear him out when the Master said he had come to aid the Doctor . When the High Council confirmed the Master ' s story , the Doctor admitted that he had done the Master an injustice by doubting him . ( TV : \" The Five Doctors \" ) The fifth incarnation showed a great loathing for violence , needless bloodshed and the pain and suffering of others . ( TV : \" The Visitation \" , \" Warriors of the Deep \" ) He failed to execute Davros in cold blood , ( TV : \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) and , at the android ' s request , reluctantly killed Kamelion . ( TV : \" Planet of Fire \" ) Despite this , he gunned down foes when he deemed it necessary , ( TV : \" Earthshock \" , \" Arc of Infinity \" , \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) and did not move to save from a fiery death , though was deeply upset by his part in it . ( TV : \" Planet of Fire \" ) He also accepted a pistol from King Louis , but only so he would not contradict the hotheaded king . ( AUDIO : \" The Church and the Crown \" ) Despite his pacifistic ways , the Fifth Doctor did possess a dark side , which he released upon his enemies when it was necessary . ( TV : \" Earthshock \" ) He could lose his temper when pushed too far , ( TV : \" Arc of Infinity \" ; AUDIO : \" Spare Parts \" ) or when around someone who annoyed him , ( TV : \" Time Crash \" ) and also showed off an immature and childish side when he argued with Adric about returning to E - Space , a place he personally did not want to go to , coming up with every excuse he could to prevent them from going . ( TV : \" Earthshock \" ) He was also willing to physically slap someone to calm them down , as with Maxwell Edison . ( COMIC : \" Stars Fell on Stockbridge \" ) He could also get impatient with those around him , especially his companions . ( TV : \" Earthshock \" , \" Snakedance \" ) Towards the end of his life , the Doctor displayed a more relaxed and controlled side . Even as he awaited execution on Androzani Minor , he was fiercely curious about the spectrox mined there . He still retained his sarcastic side , mocking Chellak ' s insistence on being addressed as \" sir \" , and reacting with humour to Sharaz Jek ' s idea of him , the Doctor and Peri becoming \" the best of companions \" . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) Although he and Tegan often argued , he told Lady Adela Forster that she was \" very dear \" to him , ( AUDIO : \" The Emerald Tiger \" ) and told Tegan that he \" [ couldn ' t ] bear the thought of not having [ her ] around \" . ( PROSE : \" Qualia \" ) In spite of this , the Doctor would often hide from her in the TARDIS ' Cloister Room . ( AUDIO : \" No Place Like Home \" ) Tegan claimed that the Doctor often gave her \" half pained , half patronising \" looks and later described him as the most annoying man that she had ever met . ( AUDIO : \" Aquitaine \" ) On one occasion , she derisively referred to the Doctor as a \" posho \" . ( AUDIO : \" The Peterloo Massacre \" ) The Doctor disliked being referred to as \" sweet \" . ( AUDIO : \" The Entropy Composition \" ) Immediately after his regeneration , the Sixth Doctor claimed that his predecessor had \" a sort of feckless charm [ that ] simply wasn ' t [ him ] \" , ( TV : \" The Twin Dilemma \" ) but later admitted to Evelyn Smythe that \" being him was like a holiday . A very wonderful holiday . \" ( AUDIO : \" The 100 Days of the Doctor \" ) The Seventh Doctor described the Fifth Doctor as \" bland \" and \" not even one of the good ones \" , while the Fifth Doctor was repulsed by his future self ' s manipulative nature . ( PROSE : \" Cold Fusion \" ) However , despite the animosity between the two , in the Seventh Doctor ' s subconscious , the Fifth Doctor personified his future selves ' conscience with his strong sense of compassion . ( PROSE : \" \" ) The Eighth Doctor was more fond of his fifth incarnation than his two immediate predecessors , describing him as \" terribly polite . \" ( AUDIO : \" The Four Doctors \" ) The Tenth Doctor expressed a fondness for his fifth incarnation , seeing him as a turning point and stating that it was after his fourth regeneration when he began to enjoy his time in younger bodies . He also confessed that certain aspects of his wardrobe and personality were influenced by the Fifth Doctor . ( TV : \" Time Crash \" ) When the Eleventh Doctor contacted his younger self through an Ovid sphere in England in the 1920s , he commented that his fifth incarnation was \" grumpy \" and \" frowny \" in part because he worried about being taken seriously due to his youthful appearance . ( AUDIO : \" Smoke and Mirrors \" ) Two days after he recovered from his post - regeneration trauma , Tegan described the Doctor as \" an incompetent lunatic who talks gibberish \" , and Adric saw him as an inferior replacement to the Fourth Doctor and a \" feckless , frivolous dilettante \" . ( AUDIO : \" Psychodrome \" ) Roz Forrester did not trust the Fifth Doctor , as she believed the fact that he seemed so trustworthy was suspicious . ( PROSE : \" Cold Fusion \" ) River Song noted the Fifth Doctor ' s \" sweet but strangely short - tempered \" personality , as well as his obsession with the Eye of Orion . ( GAME : \" The Eternity Clock \" ) After he and Peri became infected with Spectrox toxaemia , the Doctor became determined to save Peri from dying of the poison ; stealing a spaceship , outrunning armed mercenaries , climbing deep into a cave with no oxygen and back , and finally carrying Peri to the TARDIS while in the paralysis stage of the poisoning , ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) all while holding back the regenerative process . ( AUDIO : \" Winter \" ) When in the safety of the TARDIS , the Doctor selflessly gave Peri all that remained of the antidote , saving her life at the cost of his own , and redeeming himself for his failure to save Adric . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) Habits and quirks . In an occasional reminder of his actual age , the Doctor would sport a pair of glasses when examining something . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" Kinda \" , \" Frontios \" ) These were his \" brainy specs \" , which he wore to make him look \" a bit clever \" . ( TV : \" Time Crash \" ) He often delegated some decisions to a simple flip of a coin . ( TV : \" Kinda \" ) To encourage others , the Doctor would tell them to have a \" brave heart \" , especially with Tegan . ( TV : \" Earthshock \" , \" Enlightenment \" , \" Warrior of the Deep \" , \" The Awakening \" ) Although Tegan told him that she found it annoying and asked him never to say it again , he did so on numerous subsequent occasions . ( AUDIO : \" Psychodrome \" ) He was also known to say , \" Sorry , must dash \" , especially when leaving in a hurry . ( TV : \" Time - Flight \" , \" The Five Doctors \" ) Like his third incarnation , he would affectionately address people as \" old chap \" . ( AUDIO : \" Zagreus \" ) Typically , the Doctor would either stand with his hands in his pockets , flicking the long tails on his coat back in the process , ( TV : \" Earthshock \" , \" The King ' s Demons \" , \" The Five Doctors \" , \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) or stand with his hands crossed behind his back . ( TV : \" Four to Doomsday \" , \" Earthshock \" , \" Arc of Infinity \" , \" The Five Doctors \" ) He was also prone to dramatic turns , which usually caused his hair to sway wildly . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" Earthshock \" , \" Mawdryn Undead \" , \" The Five Doctors \" , \" Warriors of the Deep \" , \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) Unlike his predecessor , the Fifth Doctor was not a particularly strong drinker . ( AUDIO : \" The Kingmaker \" ) Skills . The Fifth Doctor was highly skilled at the sport of cricket , ( TV : \" Black Orchid \" ) often spending long periods of time playing the game . ( PROSE : \" Happy Endings \" , \" Goth Opera \" ; AUDIO : \" Autumn \" ) The Doctor could decipher the ingredients of a drink by smell alone ; rosemary made him sneeze . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" ) He also retained the swordfighting acumen and unarmed combat skills of his predecessors , although the latter was showcased sparingly , and only in self - defence . ( TV : \" The Visitation \" , \" The King ' s Demons \" , \" Warriors of the Deep \" , \" Resurrection of the Daleks \" ) He carried a Molenski Univarius , that he claimed could fix anything , ( AUDIO : \" The Axis of Insanity \" ) and learned how to perform coin magic from Adric . ( TV : \" Kinda \" ) After learning how to , ( COMIC : \" 4 - Dimensional Vistas \" ) the Doctor was able to swim out of danger , even while dazed , and was capable of holding his breath for a long period of time . ( TV : \" Warriors of the Deep \" ) The Doctor often showed keen observational and deductive skills , quickly solving the mystery of the murder of Sinead Iona Fleming on Fleming ' s Island fifty years after the crime ( AUDIO : \" Iterations of I \" ) and managing to piece together the true nature of the Vrall from a few scattered clues relating to the anomalous behaviour of the Translation circuit . ( PROSE : \" Imperial Moon \" ) Appearance . The Fifth Doctor resembled a young man in his late twenties , ( TV : \" Logopolis \" ) with , as Peri Brown described , \" fair blonde hair , blue eyes , and a sweet smile \" . ( AUDIO : \" Peri and the Piscon Paradox \" ) As a side - effect of his regeneration , ( PROSE : \" Cold Fusion \" ) the Doctor ' s hair regularly changed length . ( TV : \" Logopolis \" , \" Castrovalva \" ) Once , to make himself appear older , the Doctor grew a beard while he was stranded in 1867 London that helped him fit in with the scientific community . ( AUDIO : \" The Haunting of Thomas Brewster \" ) When Affinity took on the Fifth Doctor ' s appearance to approach the Twelfth Doctor , he noted that the fifth incarnation was a \" young fair - haired man in a pale coat and light striped trousers . \" ( PROSE : \" Silhouette \" ) Clothing . The Fifth Doctor had two outfits , both based on traditional cricket whites . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" The Awakening \" ) So close were they to whites that he could take off his coat and play the sport without comments on his appearance . ( TV : \" Black Orchid \" ; COMIC : \" The Tides of Time \" ) His first outfit featured a long beige - coloured frock coat with red piping along the collar , lapels , sleeves , pockets and tails . Underneath this he wore a white , long - sleeved cricket jumper with a red and black V - Neck pattern , and , under that , a white dress shirt with a red interior and embroidered red question mark s on the collars . His trousers were a unique pattern of brown and beige stripes . He also wore red or white socks and white plimsolls . He would top the look with a roll - up Panama hat that had a red band with a black and white pattern . ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" ) After his clothes were ruined in the waters of Sea Base 4 , ( TV : \" Warriors of the Deep \" ) the Doctor changed to a French grey coat with a longer collar and a jumper with a pattern of thick red and black lines on the bottom , the V - neck and sleeves . The dress shirt had a green interior and the pattern of the trousers changed to thick , orange lines . ( TV : \" The Awakening \" ) He sometimes wore suspenders adorned with question marks and , on one occasion , replaced his jumper with a beige coloured waistcoat that had a gold , white and red flora & fauna pattern . ( TV : \" Planet of Fire \" ) He wore a stick of artificial celery on his left lapel ( TV : \" Castrovalva \" , \" Enlightenment \" ) for his allergy to gas es in the praxis range of the spectrum . If any were near , the celery would turn purple and he would eat it . ( TV : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) Ironically , the Doctor himself hated celery . ( AUDIO : \" The Gathering \" ) When his first incarnation was placed on trial in London in 1963 as a result of killing a werewolf with a silver bullet , the Doctor dressed more conservatively , wearing an ill - fitting grey suit . ( PROSE : \" The Juror ' s Story \" ) Behind the scenes . Casting . After the popular fourth incarnation , it was decided that the next incarnation should be played by an actor who was already firmly established in the British public ' s mind . Peter Davison was chosen , due in no small part to his popular and critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in \" All Creatures Great and Small \" , a BBC series based on the books of James Herriot . Richard Griffiths was considered for the role before Peter Davison was cast . The age gap . Only 29 when cast , he remained \" the youngest Doctor \" until the 2009 hiring of 26 - year - old Matt Smith . He was some eleven years younger than Tom Baker , the previous record holder , seven years younger than Paul McGann , and five years younger than future son - in - law , David Tennant . He was later recast as the Fifth Doctor in \" Time Crash \" in 2007 , at which time he was 56 , a year older than William Hartnell was during the filming of \" An Unearthly Child \" . Bad hair years . To a degree never seen with any other regular character before or since , the Fifth Doctor was at the heart of a running continuity error . No make - up artist seemed to particularly care about the length of Davison ' s hair throughout season 19 , despite the fact that it was known that serial s were being recorded out of broadcast order . Davison , a busy actor with other commitments , had his hair cut short at the beginning of \" Doctor Who \" s production block s , because other projects like \" All Creatures Great and Small \" required it . For reasons unclear , he was then allowed to grow his hair several inches while filming as the Fifth Doctor . However , since the episodes aired out of order , his hair length quite obviously varied . Were it not for the fact that most serials of season 19 narratively dovetailed into each other , it might be possible to simply believe that the character simply liked to go to the barber shop between stories . Unfortunately for this theory , \" Four to Doomsday \" was narratively tied to the beginning of \" Kinda \" , so the jarring hair growth can only be regarded as a production error . Davison cut his hair prior to each season , and the production team allowed him to grow it throughout each of his production block s . However , \" Snakedance \" was the final story of his tenure broadcast out of production order , and \" Arc of Infinity \" didn ' t obviously lead into it . Thus , although Davison was again allowed to grow his hair throughout the production of seasons 20 and 21 , it never amounted to the kind of production error it was throughout season 19 . It ' s frequently remarked by Davison on DVD commentaries that \" real \" fans can tell the production order of episodes by the length of the Fifth Doctor ' s hair . Brainy specs . In several DVD commentaries , Peter Davison claims he abandoned his half - moon glasses because Janet Fielding teased him when he used them . Fielding seemed to agree with this assessment on the commentary for \" Earthshock \" . Celery . Davison agreed to wear a stick of celery on his lapel on the understanding that JNT would eventually have a writer explain the bizarre fashion statement . Though Davison thought the explanation would come earlier , the mystery was at last revealed in his final story . ( DCOM : \" The Caves of Androzani \" ) Ironically , Davison hated celery . When he was required to eat celery during the recording of \" Castrovalva \" , he found it deeply unpleasant . ( DCOM : \" Castrovalva \" )", "document_id": "0D8169B46F1B9C66"}
