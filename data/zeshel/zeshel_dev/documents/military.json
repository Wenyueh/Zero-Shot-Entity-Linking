He was one of the commanders of the Egyptian forces that inflicted a devastating defeat on the Seventh Crusade of King Louis IX of France . He also led the vanguard of the Egyptian army at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 , which marked the first substantial defeat of the Mongol army , and is considered a turning point in history . Baibars ' reign marked the start of an age of Mamluk dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean , and solidified the durability of their military system . He managed to pave the way for the end of the Crusader presence in the Levant , and reinforced the union of Egypt and Syria as the region ' s pre - eminent Arab and Muslim state , able to fend off threats from both Crusaders and Mongols . As Sultan , Baibars also engaged in a combination of diplomacy and military action , which allowed the Mamluks of Egypt to greatly expand their empire . Biography . Early life . Born in the Dasht - I - Kipchak , between rivers of Edil ( Volga ) and Yaiyk ( Ural ) , Baibars was a Turkic Kipchak / Cuman ( from Berish tribe , that currently lives in Kazakhstan ) . He was fair - skinned , blond , very tall and had a cataract in one of his bluish eyes . It was said that he was captured by the Mongols in the Kipchak steppe and sold as a slave , ending up in Syria . Baibars was quickly sold to a Mamluk officer called Aydekin al bondouqdar , and sent to Egypt , where he became a bodyguard to the Ayyubid ruler As - Salih Ayyub . Rise to power . Baibars was a commander of the Mamluks in around 1250 , when he defeated the Seventh Crusade of Louis IX of France . He was still a commander under Sultan Qutuz at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 , when he decisively defeated the Mongols . After the battle , Sultan Qutuz ( aka Koetoez ) was assassinated while on a hunting expedition . It was said that Baibars was involved in the assassination because he expected to be rewarded with the governorship of Aleppo for his military success ; but Qutuz , fearing his ambition , refused to give such a post and disappointed him . Baibars succeeded Qutuz as Sultan of Egypt . Sultan of Egypt . He continued what was to become a lifelong struggle against the Crusader kingdoms in Syria , starting with the Principality of Antioch , which had become a vassal state of the Mongols , and participated in attacks against Islamic targets in Damascus and Syria . In 1263 , Baibars attacked Acre , the capital of the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem , but was unable to take it . Nevertheless , he defeated the Crusaders in many other battles ( Arsuf , Athlith , Haifa , Safad , Jaffa , Ashkalon , Caesarea ) . In 1266 Baibars invaded the Christian country of Cilician Armenia , which , under King Hethum I , had submitted to the Mongol Empire . This isolated Antioch and Tripoli , led by Hetum ' s son - in - law , Prince Bohemond VI . In 1268 , Baibars besieged Antioch , capturing the city on 18 May . Baibars had promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants , but broke his promise and had the city razed , killing or enslaving the population upon surrender . This tactic was common in Baibars ' campaigns , and was largely responsible for the swiftness of his victories . Baibars then turned his attention to Tripoli , but interrupted his siege there to call a truce in May 1271 . The fall of Antioch had led to the brief Ninth Crusade , led by Prince Edward of England , who arrived in Acre in May 1271 and attempted to ally with the Mongols against Baibars . So Baibars declared a truce with Tripoli , as well as with Edward ( who was never able to capture any territory from Baibars anyway ) . According to some reports , Baibars tried to have Edward assassinated with poison , but Edward survived the attempt , and returned home in 1272 . In 1277 , Baibars invaded the Seljuq Sultanate of R\u00fbm , then dominated by the Mongols . He defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Elbistan , captured the city of Kayseri , but was unable to hold any of his Anatolian conquests and quickly withdrew to Syria . Death . Baibars died in Damascus on 1 July 1277 . His demise has been the subject of some academic speculation . Many sources agree that he died from drinking poisoned kumis that was intended for someone else . Other accounts suggest that he may have died from a wound while campaigning , or from illness . He was buried in the Az - Zahiriyah Library in Damascus . Family . Baibars married several women and had seven daughters and three sons . Two of his sons , al - Said Barakah and Solamish , became sultans . Assessment . As the first Sultan of the Bahri Mamluk dynasty , Baibars made the meritocratic ascent up the ranks of Mamluk society . He took final control after the assassination of Sultan Sayf al Din Qutuz , but before he became Sultan he was the commander of the Mamluk forces in the most important battle of the Middle Periods , repelling a Mongol force at the legendary Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 . Although in the Muslim World he has been considered a national hero for centuries , and in Egypt , Syria and Kazakhstan is still regarded as such , Sultan Baibars was reviled in the Christian world of the time for his seemingly unending victorious campaigns . A Templar knight who fought in the Seventh Crusade lamented : Baibars also played an important role in bringing the Mongols to Islam . He developed strong ties with the Mongols of the Golden Horde and took steps for the Golden Horde Mongols to travel to Egypt . The arrival of the Golden Horde Mongols to Egypt resulted in a significant number of Mongols accepting Islam . Legacy . Baibars was a popular ruler in the Muslim World who had defeated the crusaders in three campaigns , and the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut which many scholars deem of great macro - historical importance . In order to support his military campaigns , Baibars commissioned arsenals , warships and cargo vessels . He was also arguably the first to employ explosive hand cannon s in war , at the Battle of Ain Jalut . His military campaign also extended into Libya and Nubia . He was also an efficient administrator who took interest in building various infrastructure projects , such as a mounted message relay system capable of delivery from Cairo to Damascus in four days . He also built bridges , irrigation and shipping canals , improved the harbours , and built mosques . He was also a patron of Islamic science , such as his support for the medical research by his Arab physician , Ibn al - Nafis . As a testament of a special relationship between Islam and cats , Baibars left a cat garden in Cairo as a waqf , providing the cats of Cairo with food and shelter . His memoirs were recorded in \" Sirat al - Zahir Baibars \" ( \" Life of al - Zahir Baibars \" ) , a popular Arabic romance recording his battles and achievements . He has a heroic status in Kazakhstan , as well as in Egypt and Syria . \" Al - Madrassa al - Zahiriyya \" is the school built adjacent to his Mausoleum in Damascus . The Az - Zahiriyah library , has a wealth of manuscripts in various branches of knowledge to this day . The library and Mausoleum are being reconstructed by Kazakhstan government fund . Presently the Minister of Culture and Information of Kazakhstan Mukhtar Kul - Mukhammed said that within the realization of Cultural Heritage Kazakh Strategic Project for 2009 \u2013 2011 Astana have launched reconstruction of the Sultan Beibars Mausoleum in Damascus and his Mosque in Cairo in order to propagate Kazakhstan ' s national historical heritage on the international level .", "document_id": "17E2687A61CE4D45"}
{"title": "Siege of Antioch ( 1268 )", "text": "Siege of Antioch ( 1268 ) The Siege of Antioch occurred in 1268 when the Mamelukes under Baibars finally succeeded in capturing the city of Antioch . Prior to the siege , the Crusader Principality was oblivious to the loss of the city as demonstrated when Baibars sent negotiators to the leader of the former Crusader state and mocking his use of \" Prince \" in the title Prince of Antioch . Prelude to the Siege . In 1260 Baibars , the Sultan of Egypt and Syria , began to threaten the Principality of Antioch , a Crusader state , which ( as a vassal of the Armenians ) had supported the Mongols , the traditional enemies of the Turks . In 1265 , Baibars took Caesarea , Haifa and Arsuf and massacred the inhabitants . A year later , Baibars conquered Galilee and devastated Cilician Armenia . As Steven Runciman relates in his last book about the Crusades , time ago before the siege of Antioch ( 1268 ) , prince Bohemond IV of Antioch had settled his court in the city of Tripoli , capital of his other state , the County of Tripoli . In 1268 , the Antiochene knights and garrison were under the command of Simon Mansel , Constable of Antioch , whose wife was an Armenian Lady who was relative to Sybilla of Armenia , wife of prince Bohemond VI . Siege of Antioch . In 1268 Baibars besieged the city of Antioch which was \" badly defended by its patriarch and abandoned by most of its inhabitants , \" capturing it on 18 May ( the citadel fell two days later ) after a relatively feeble defense . Antioch had been weakened by its previous struggles with Armenia and internal power struggles , and Antioch ' s inhabitants were quick to agree to a surrender on the condition that the lives of the citizens within the walls would be spared . Before Baibars ' forces laid siege on Antioch , the Constable Simon Mansel , along with a group of knights led an unsuccessful attack against the Muslim army in order that the city could not be encircled . The defenses were in good conditions , but the garrison was unable to defend the long walls of the city . Mansel was captured during the Antiochene cavalry attack , and Baibars ordered him to command his lieutenants in Antioch to surrender immediately to him . The garrison refused to capitulate , and continued the defense of the walls . Baibars reneged on this pledge ; as soon as his troops were within the gates , Baibars ordered the gates shut and brutally massacred everyone in the city . It is thought that 40 , 000 Christians were massacred and another 100 , 000 enslaved . Afterward , lamenting that Antioch ' s ruler had not been present either for the siege or the ransacking and murder , Baibars secretary ( who was also his biographer ) wrote a detailed letter describing exactly what had been done to the people and the city : ' Death came among the besieged from all sides and by all roads : we killed all that thou hadst appointed to guard the city or defend its approaches . If thou hadst seen thy knights trampled under the feet of the horses , thy provinces given up to pillage , thy riches distributed by measures full , the wives of thy subjects put to public sale ; if thou hadst seen the pulpits and crosses overturned , the leaves of the Gospel torn and cast to the winds , and the sepulchres of thy patriarchs profaned ; if thou hadst seen thy enemies , the Mussulmans trampling upon the tabernacle , and immolating in the sanctuary , monk , priest and deacon ; in short , if thou hadst seen thy palaces given up to the flames , the dead devoured by the fire of this world , the Church of St Paul and that of St Peter completely and entirely destroyed , certes , thou wouldst have cried out \" \" Would to Heaven that I were become dust ! \" \" ' . Michaud after quoting the letter of Baibar ' s concludes the sacking thus : ' Baibars distributed the booty among his soldiers the Mamelukes reserving as their portion the women girls and children [ . . . ] A little boy was worth twelve dirhems , a little girl five dirhems . In a single day the city of Antioch lost all its inhabitants and a conflagration lighted by order of Bibars completed the work of the barbarians . Most historians agree in saying that fourteen thousand Christians were slaughtered and a hundred thousand dragged away into slavery . ' Aftermath . The Hospitaller fortress Krak des Chevaliers fell three years later . While Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade ostensibly to reverse these setbacks , it went to Tunis , instead of Constantinople , as Louis ' brother , Charles of Anjou , had initially advised , though Charles I clearly benefited from the treaty between Antioch and Tunis that ultimately resulted from the Crusade . By the time of his death in 1277 , Baibars had forced the Crusaders to a few strongholds along the coast and the Crusaders were forced out of the Middle East by the beginning of the fourteenth century . The fall of Antioch was to prove as detrimental to the crusaders cause , as its capture was instrumental to the initial success of the first Crusade . The population of Antioch consisting primarily of Armenians was put to the sword . Later , the Mamelukes would repeat the same destruction in Acre where the massacre of the civilians there was frustrated by the evacuation attempts of the Templar Knights , who managed to save a number of civilians to the relative safety of Cyprus .", "document_id": "925ED6501F6D4BD6"}
{"title": "Battle of Inab", "text": "Battle of Inab The Battle of Inab , also called Battle of Ard al - H\u00e2tim or Fons Muratus , was fought on 29 June 1149 , during the Second Crusade . The Syrian army of Atabeg Nur ad - Din Zangi destroyed the combined army of Prince Raymond of Antioch and the Hashshashin of Ali ibn - Wafa . The Principality of Antioch was subsequently pillaged and reduced in size as its eastern border was pushed west . Background . After the death of Nur ad - Din ' s father Zengi in 1146 , Raymond of Antioch invaded the vulnerable province of Aleppo ( part of the Seljuq Empire ) , which was threatened by hostile powers on all sides . After establishing his own authority in Aleppo and successfully defending Damascus in 1147 , Nur ad - Din invaded Antioch in late 1148 and besieged Afamiya . Raymond beat him off and captured his baggage train . When he returned a few months later to attack Yaghra , Raymond , at the head of a small force , forced him to retire to Aleppo . In June 1149 , Nur ad - Din invaded Antioch and besieged the fortress of Inab , with aid from Unur of Damascus and a force of Turcoman s . Nur ad - Din had about 6 , 000 troops , mostly cavalry , at his disposal . Raymond and his Christian neighbor , Count Joscelin II of Edessa , had been enemies since Raymond had refused to send a relief army to Edessa in 1146 . Joscelin even made a treaty of alliance with Nur ad - Din against Raymond . For their part , Raymond II of Tripoli and the regent , Melisende of Jerusalem refused to aid the Prince of Antioch . Feeling confident because he had twice defeated Nur ad - Din previously , Prince Raymond struck out on his own with an army of 400 knights and 1 , 000 foot soldiers . Battle . Prince Raymond allied himself with Ali ibn - Wafa , leader of the Hashshashin and an enemy of Nur ad - Din . Before he had collected all his available forces , Raymond and his ally mounted a relief expedition . Amazed at the weakness of Prince Raymond ' s army , the atabeg at first suspected that it was only an advance guard and that the main Frankish army must be lurking nearby . Upon the approach of the combined force , Nur ad - Din raised the siege of Inab and withdrew . Rather than staying close to the stronghold , Raymond and ibn - Wafa camped with their forces in open country . After Nur ad - Din ' s scouts noted that the allies camped in an exposed location and did not receive reinforcements , the atabeg swiftly surrounded the enemy camp during the night . On June 29 , Nur ad - Din attacked and destroyed the army of Antioch . Presented with an opportunity to escape , the Prince of Antioch refused to abandon his soldiers . Raymond was a man of \" immense stature \" and fought back , \" cutting down all who came near him \" . Nevertheless , both Raymond and ibn - Wafa were killed , along with Reynald of Marash . A few Franks escaped the disaster . Much of the territory of Antioch was now open to Nur ad - Din , the most important of which was a route to the Mediterranean . Nur ad - Din rode out to the coast and bathed in the sea as a symbol of his conquest . The contemporary historian William of Tyre blamed the Antiochenes ' defeat on Raymond ' s rashness . One modern historian says the Crusader defeat at Inab was \" as disastrous at that of the Ager Sanguinis \" a generation earlier . Yet another remarks that it \" was not part of a watershed moment , and should not be seen in the context of the Second Crusade \" . Aftermath . After his victory , Nur ad - Din went on to capture the fortresses of Artah , Harim and \u2018 Imm , which defended the approach to Antioch itself . Harim was not recovered until 1157 , then lost permanently in 1164 . He sent the main party of his army to besiege Afamiya . After plundering the region , he besieged Antioch , which was virtually defenceless because of the loss of its prince and its army . The city was divided between a surrender party and a resistance party . The latter , led by Raymond ' s widow , Constance , and the Patriarch , Aimery of Limoges , prevailed , and Nur ad - Din was bought off , with some of the treasure coming from the Patriarch ' s own possessions . A small force was left behind to prevent reinforcements from entering the city , while Nur ad - Din went down to the sea to bathe in it as a sign of victory . He plundered the lands around Saint Simeon ' s Monastery and then rejoined his forces to capture Afamiya . Upon receiving news that King Baldwin III of Jerusalem was marching north with some Templars to relieve the siege , Nur ad - Din opened negotiations . The border between Antioch and Aleppo was re - drawn to Nur ad - Din ' s gain and the armies went home . Joscelin now found that his enemy Raymond ' s defeat and death placed his own possessions in extreme peril . Joscelin would soon be captured by Nur ed - Din ( 1150 ) and what remained of his County of Edessa evacuated by its Latin inhabitants . After the victory at Inab , Nur ad - Din became a hero throughout the Islamic world . His goal became the destruction of the Crusader state s , and the strengthening of Islam through \" jihad \" ; he had already set up religious schools and new mosques in Aleppo , and expelled those he considered heretics from his territory , especially Shiites . \" Jihad \" was influenced by the presence of the Christian Crusader states as it could be used as an excuse for maintenance of a permanent state of war . Nur ad - Din went on to capture the remnants of the County of Edessa , and brought Damascus under his rule in 1154 , further weakening the Crusader states .", "document_id": "AA47DC8B46ABB4BE"}
{"title": "Battle of Harran", "text": "Battle of Harran The Battle of Harran took place on May 7 , 1104 between the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa , and the Seljuk Turks . It was the first major battle against the newfound Crusader states in the aftermath of the First Crusade marking a key turning point against Frankish expansion . The battle had a disastrous effect on the Principality of Antioch as the Turks regained territory earlier lost . Background . In 1104 Baldwin II of Edessa had attacked and besieged the city of Harran . For his further support Baldwin sought help from Bohemond I of Antioch and Tancred , Prince of Galilee . Bohemond and Tancred marched north from Antioch to Edessa to join with Baldwin and Joscelin of Courtenay , accompanied by Bernard of Valence the Patriarch of Antioch , Daimbert of Pisa the Patriarch of Jerusalem , and Benedict the Archbishop of Edessa . The Seljuks , under Jikirmish , governor of Mosul , and Sokman , the Artuqid lord of Mardin , gathered in the area of the Khabur , perhaps at Ra ' s al - ' ain ( Hellenistic Rhesaina ) . In May 1104 they attacked Edessa , perhaps to distract the crusaders from Harran , perhaps to take the city while the crusaders were elsewhere engaged . The battle . According to Ibn al - Qalanisi , Tancred and Bohemund arrived at Edessa during the siege , but according to \" Chronicle of 1234 \" they arrived first at the gates of Harran . In any case , the Seljuks rode away from the crusaders , feigning a retreat and the crusaders followed . The Seljuks feigned retreat in the preliminary skirmishes while the Crusaders continued their pursuit south . The contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa reports a pursuit of two days while Ralph of Caen reports three days . According to Ibn al - Athir , the main battle was fought twelve kilometres from Harran . Most historians accept the accounts of Albert of Aachen and Fulcher of Chartres , who located the battle on the plain ( \" planitie \" ) opposite the city of ar - Raqqah , Ar - Raqqah being about two days away from Harran . Baldwin and Joscelin commanded the Edessan left wing while Bohemond and Tancred commanded the Antiochene right . Ralph of Caen says that the crusaders were caught unawares when the Seljuks turned to fight , so much so that Baldwin and Bohemond fought without armor . During the battle itself , Baldwin ' s troops were completely routed , with Baldwin and Joscelin captured by the Turks . The Antiochene troops along with Bohemond were able to escape to Edessa . However , Jikirmish had only taken a small amount of booty , so he purloined Baldwin from Sokman ' s camp . Although a ransom was paid , Joscelin and Baldwin were not released until sometime before 1108 , and 1108 respectively . Significance . The battle was one of the first decisive Crusader defeats with severe consequences to the Principality of Antioch . The Byzantine Empire took advantage of the defeat to impose their claims on Antioch , and recaptured Latakia and parts of Cilicia . Many of the towns ruled by Antioch revolted and were re - occupied by Muslim forces from Aleppo . Armenia n territories also revolted in favour of the Byzantines or Armenia . Furthermore , these events caused Bohemund to return to Italy to recruit more troops , leaving Tancred as regent of Antioch . William of Tyre wrote that there was no battle more disastrous than this . Although Antioch recovered by the next year , the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus imposed the Treaty of Devol on Bohemond , which would have made Antioch a vassal of the empire had Tancred agreed to it . Antioch was again crushed at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119 ; Edessa never really recovered and survived until 1144 only because of divisions among the Muslims .", "document_id": "4C1FBD9A6522C73D"}
{"title": "Yaghi - Siyan", "text": "Yaghi - Siyan Yaghi - Siyan ( died June 3 , 1098 ) was the governor of Antioch during the First Crusade . He was a Turkic slave of the Seljuk sultan Malik Shah I , who had captured Antioch in 1085 and appointed Yaghi - Siyan governor around 1090 . Malik Shah died in 1092 , and his successor Tutush I granted Yaghi - Siyan more territory around Manbij and Turbessel . When Tutush died in 1095 , his sons , Ridwan and Duqaq , fought for control of Syria , claiming Aleppo and Damascus respectively . Ridwan ' s claim to Aleppo was opposed by an alliance of Yaghi - Siyan , Ilghazi , and Duqaq . Yaghi - Siyan disliked Ridwan ' s tutor Janah ad - Dawla more than he disliked Ridwan himself , and thus allied with Duqaq instead . Ridwan and his allies attacked Yaghi - Siyan ' s territory , and then besieged Damascus when Duqaq and Ilghazi came to assist Antioch . In 1097 Ridwan quarrelled with Janah ad - Dawla , and Yaghi - Siyan became more amenable to an alliance . This was completed by marrying his daughter to Ridwan . The two were about to attack Shaizar when news of the crusade arrived , and all parties retreated to their own territories to prepare for the coming attacks . Siege of Antioch . Despite the alliance , Yaghi - Siyan was left alone to fight the crusaders with only his personal army in Antioch . To prepare for a siege , he exiled many of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox Christians , whom he considered untrustworthy . He imprisoned the Greek Patriarch , John the Oxite , and converted the Cathedral of St . Peter into a stable . The Syrian Orthodox Christians were generally left alone , as Yaghi - Siyan considered them to be more loyal to him , as enemies of the Greeks and Armenians . Over the winter of 1097 - 1098 , Antioch was besieged by the Crusaders , and Yaghi - Siyan and his son Shams ad - Dawla sought help from Duqaq . He frequently sent out sorties against the Christian camp , and attacked foraging parties further afield . Yaghi - Siyan knew from his informants that there were dissensions among the Christians ; both Raymond IV of Toulouse and Bohemund of Taranto wanted the city for themselves . While Bohemund was away foraging on December 29 , 1097 , Raymond attacked but was pushed back by Yaghi - Siyan ' s troops . On December 30 , reinforcements from Duqaq were defeated by Bohemund ' s foraging party , and retreated to Homs . Yaghi - Siyan then turned to Ridwan for assistance . In February Ridwan ' s army was also defeated ; while the crusader army was away from the city fighting Ridwan , Yaghi - Siyan marched out to attack the foot - soldiers left behind to defend the camp , but he too was pushed back when the victorious crusaders returned . In March Yaghi - Siyan ambushed the crusaders who were bringing wood and other material back from the port of St . Simeon ; when the crusader camp at Antioch heard that Raymond and Bohemund had been killed , there was mass confusion , and Yaghi - Siyan attacked the rest of the army under Godfrey of Bouillon . Bohemund and Raymond soon returned however , and Yaghi - Siyan was once more pushed back into the city . This time the governor turned to Kerbogha of Mosul for help . The crusaders knew they had to take the city before Kerbogha ' s reinforcements arrived . Bohemund secretly negotiated with one of Yaghi - Siyan ' s guards , an Armenia n named Firuz , who agreed to betray the city . Death . On the night of June 2 - June 3 , 1098 , the crusaders entered the city ; Yaghi - Siyan fled with his bodyguard , while his son stayed behind to defend the citadel . During his escape , Yaghi - Siyan fell from his horse , and as his guards found it impossible to bring the injured governor with them , they left him on the ground and rode away without him . He was found by an Armenian who cut off his head and sent it as a gift to Bohemund . Antioch was claimed by Bohemund and Raymond , with Raymond stationed in Yaghi - Siyan ' s residence and Bohemund in the citadel when it was captured from Shams ad - Dawla the next week . Their quarrel delayed the crusade for many months . The crusaders recorded Yaghi - Siyan ' s name in various forms in Latin , including Acxianus , Gratianus , and Cassianus ; the residence claimed by Raymond was known as the \" palatium Cassiani \" .", "document_id": "05A5193B150D13FB"}
{"title": "Battle of Hab", "text": "Battle of Hab In the Battle of Hab on August 14 , 1119 , a Crusader army commanded by King Baldwin II of Jerusalem won a disputed victory over a Muslim army led by Ilghazi of Mardin since the Muslim army claimed it as a victory . The battle partially stabilized the Principality of Antioch which had suffered a disastrous defeat only weeks before . Background . On June 28 , 1119 , Ilghazi ' s Turco - Syrian army destroyed the Antiochene army at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis . After his great victory , the Muslim leader ' s army captured a number of strongholds in the Latin principality , but more might have been achieved . \" The failure of Il Ghazi to profit from his major victory . . . was due not only to his own subsequent and prolonged drunkenness , but to the scattering of his forces in search of plunder . \" As soon as he heard the news , King Baldwin brought a force north from his Kingdom of Jerusalem to rescue Antioch . On the way , he picked up a contingent from the County of Tripoli under Count Pons . Baldwin assembled the remnants of Antioch ' s army and added them to his own soldiers . Then he moved toward Zerdana , 65 kilometers east - southeast of Antioch , which was besieged by Ilghazi . While camped at the Tell Danith watering point , Baldwin found out that Zerdana had fallen . Accordingly , the Crusaders prepared to retreat to the stronghold of Hab , c . 25 kilometers southwest of Zerdana . Battle . On the morning of August 14 , Baldwin carefully arranged the Frankish army for its retreat through open country . Leading the way were three squadrons of 700 knights . Behind them marched the several thousand infantryman , composed of bowmen and spearmen . Count Pons with his Tripolitan knights guarded the right flank . A body of Antiochene knights under Robert Fulcoy protected the left flank . More knights from Antioch guarded the rear . Baldwin led a reserve of mounted knights from Jerusalem , but it is not clear in what part of the formation he marched . The Artuqids hoped to provoke the Frankish cavalry into launching a premature charge or to open gaps in the enemy infantry formation . When such a favorable opportunity presented itself , they closed in to fight it out with lance and sword . As anticipated , the Artuqid horse archers began harassing the column at dawn . Ilghazi ' s attacks soon increased in intensity and the Crusader army was probably brought to a halt fairly early in the day . The three vanguard squadrons were dispersed and the main body of Latin infantry came under serious attack . The infantry sturdily defended itself , but , without its normal cavalry support , suffered heavy losses . On the left flank , Robert Fulcoy overcame the force opposed to him . But , after pursuing the Artuqids , he rode off with his knights to look into the possibility of retaking his stronghold of Zerdana . Meanwhile , the knights under Count Pons were scattered and some fled as far away as Antioch and Tripoli , spreading the news of a disaster . Count Pons and a handful of knights rallied to join Baldwin ' s reserve where they continued the contest . With adroit use of his reserve knights , Baldwin saved the day . By intervening at each threatened sector , he held his army together during the long and bitter fight . Eventually , the Artuqids admitted defeat and withdrew from the battlefield . Results . In Baldwin ' s narrow tactical victory , the Crusaders suffered serious losses . It may be surmised that the Turkish army also took painful losses , since Ilghazi withdrew his men from the fight , though claimed victory nevertheless . One historian notes that , \" without opposition , Baldwin was able to recapture some of the places lost . \" Strategically , it was a Christian victory which preserved the Principality of Antioch for several generations . The next major engagement in the area was the Battle of Azaz in 1125 .", "document_id": "133334E1BF865C0C"}
